A Wordle clone written in Cody BASIC.
You have to guess a 5-letter word and have 5 attempts to do so.
Letters that are in the correct position are highlighted in green. Letters that are in the word but not in the correct position are highlighted in yellow. Letters that are not in the word remain gray.
Press the Cody button to start the game. This stops an internal timer, which is used to select a random word.
